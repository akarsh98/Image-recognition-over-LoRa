Today, we are going to have a look at the HuskyLens module from DFRobot. It is an AI powered camera module with the built in capabilities of doing complex tasks such as object detection, face recognition, line detection etc. It has a camera on board, a LCD screen to display the objects in front of the camera, Three LEDs(2 white and 1 RGB), Two buttons(a push button for learning function of the module and a slider switch to toggle between the functions of the module. This module is a great choice for applications like Face recognition etc. as we don't need to mess up with the complex algorithms for these functions everythong is handled by the module itself.

In this project, we will use HuskyLens to detect objects and recognize faces and after that transmit the data collected by the module with the help of RYLR907 LoRa module to another LoRa module connected to an ESP8266 and display the data on the Serial monitor of the Arduino IDE. The RYLR907 module is capable of transmitting data to a large distance i.e. of the order of km without any internet or other required services.
Materials used in the project are:
  1) HuskyLens:[https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1922.html](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1922.html)
